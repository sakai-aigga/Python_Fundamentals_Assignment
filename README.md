# Python Fundamentals Assignment
## Overview on the Project
This repo consists of all the programs that I coded under a crash course project. 
This project is the basics that I learned under the of Python programming course.
The project is divided into 4 sections:

    1. Task 1 Datatypes -> This section consists of all the basic data types in python. 
    I have included int, float, string, boolean, list, tuple, and dictionary. 
    Each data type has its own program that demonstrates its usage.
    
    2. Task 2 Control structure -> This program consists pf the concept of if-else
    statements and while loop in Python. The program simply determines whether the 
    user input number is positive, negative or the number is zero.
    
    3. Task 3 Calculator -> This program is a simple calculator that takes in two 
    operands as input from the user and operate them as per the users choice.
    
    4. Task 4 To-Do list app -> To-Do list is the last program in the list and 
    combines almost all of the concepts that I learned throughout the course. 
    This program is a simple to-do list app that allows users to add, delete 
    and view tasks. The tasks are stored in a list and the user can interact 
    with the list using the provided options.

Also there are some other tasks that I performed during the course:
    
    Task: Temperature Converter: This is a simple program that asks user ti input 
    a temperature value and its unit and converts it to the other degree unit. 
    Such as, if you enter a value in celcius then the programs returns its value in 
    fahrenheit.

Another task here is on Data Analysis. This task involves using the attributes of
libraries like Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib:

    Task: NEPSE data analysis: A sample data has been retrieved on the 65 days 
    NEPSE Index value and we are to analyze the data on some given scenarios 
    like searching the index of last 7  days and plotting them in a graph.
    Varius concepts and attributes has been used to build this program.
    
## The code is free for you to copy and make changes to.
