# Python_Fundamentals_Assignment
This repo consists of all the programs that I coded under a crash course project. This project is the basics that I learned under the of Python programming course.
The project is divided into 4 sections:
    1. Task 1 Datatypes -> This section consists of all the basic data types in python. I have included int, float, string, boolean, list, tuple, and dictionary. Each data type has its own program that demonstrates its usage.

    2. Task 2 Control structure -> This program consists pf the concept of if-else statements and while loop in Python. The program simply determines whether the user input number is positive, negative or the number is zero.

    3. Task 3 Calculator -> This program is a simple calculator that takes in two operands as input from the user and operate them as per the users choice.

    4. Task 4 To-Do list app -> To-Do list is the last program in the list and combines almost all of the concepts that I learned throughout the course. This program is a simple to-do list app that allows users to add, delete and view tasks. The tasks are stored in a list and the user can interact with the list using the provided options.
