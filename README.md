# Python_Fundamentals_Assignment
This repo consists of all the programs that I coded under a crash course project. The project was to learn the basics of Python programming. Below are the details of each program.

The first task data_types.py was to identify the different data types in Python. It includes the following data types: int, float, str, bool

The other task was a program to understand the concept of control structures and the program is named control_structures.py. It includes if-else statements and while loop.

The third task was to create a simple calculator and that could do basic operations between two operands.

The last and the final task was the To-Do list app. This task took the longest to code and there were a lot of trial and errors. The program is named todo_list.py and simply allows users to add, delete and view tasks. This task consisted a combination of most of the concepts learned throughout the course.
